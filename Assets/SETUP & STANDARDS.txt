# Setup and Standards Doc
The purpose of this short doc is to get us all on the same page regarding a few important things such as world scale, layers, prefab setups, etc.

## World Scale
We will be using Unity's default 1 m = 1 Unity Unit. Note animations don't scale well.

## Layers
So far the layers of note are `Walkable` and `Enemy`, and are self-explanatory in their use. Note it is the collider that receives the raycast, so do apply layers to children.
